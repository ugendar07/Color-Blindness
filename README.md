# Analysis of Red-Green Gene Configuration for Color Blindness

## Overview
This project aimed to determine the most likely red-green gene configuration leading to color blindness by aligning reads to reference sequences and counting reads mapping to exons of the red and green genes. The analysis considered up to two mismatches and assigned probabilities to each configuration based on read mappings.

## Data Set
